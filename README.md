<h1 align="center">ERPNext Documents Export</h1>

A simple command line utility to automatically export ERPNext or Frappe documents to PDF (and JSON).

**Why?** While using ERPNext we were looking for a way to always have our submitted sales and purchase invoices available in PDF format, for easy referencing.
This simple tool does just that.
